        <b>Hobbies | </b> I enjoy reading high fantasy books (Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings etc.), biographies of influential people (Steven Jobs, Elon Musk) as well as technical books (A+ Certification). I have played guitar for six years. For any guitar enthusiasts I have a Schecter Hellraiser Special, an Epiphone Les Paul, and an Indie Standard Floyd in black. My rig consists of a Zakk Wylde distortion pedal run through a Blackstar HT-5 amplifier. I played house league hockey for about 9 years before I reached university and am still an avid fan of the sport.

        <b>Interests | </b>  I mainly listen to hard rock and metal bands as the songs are technically challenging to play on guitar. I enjoy keeping up with advancements in technology and read many articles each day to learn more (I suggest using 'Pocket' for iOS to save articles and links for later if you are busy at the time of seeing them). In the future I would love to work in the fields of computer security, game development, or hardware design. Currently I enjoy writing in assembly language in my Computer Architecture course. We are working with the NIOS II processor supplied by Altera.
