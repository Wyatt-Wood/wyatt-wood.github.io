    <h1> Wooden Bike</h1> <p class = "content">JAN - APR 2015</p>
    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content"> A wooden bike was developed by a team of 4 students at Queen's University as a design for the first-year, full-semester design course, APSC-100. Several reports were written that included a: project proposal, two progress reports, and a final report. These detailed the: project plan, project timeline, economic considerations, relevant research, and a complete force analysis of the ideal bicycle. The final result was presented to the class that included a demo and a summary of the design. </p>

    <h1> Visual Toolbox </h1> <p class = "content">NOV - DEC 2015</p>
    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content">  
        A significant amount of social infrastructure has been organized under the assumption that all members of society have full vision. Small visual displays; menus, buttons, and icons that require sight; as well as colour-coded user interfaces, present daily challenges to individuals with visual impairments.
         Visual toolbox was developed at Queen's University by a team of four as a design project for the second-year computer engineering course, APSC-200. The application interface was designed with the needs of the visually impaired in mind, and can be used in in conjunction with Talk Back.
            Visual Toolbox presents two features that can be used by visually impaired individuals to better understand their environment. For example, the Light Sensor can be used to guide a visually impaired person to a light that has been left on, while the colour sensor can help them sort their white and dark clothes before doing laundry.
        Several reports were written that included a: project proposal, two progress reports, and a final report. These detailed the: project plan, project timeline, economic considerations, relevant research, and a final developed android application. The final result was presented to the class that included a demo and a pitch to sell the product to a group of students.

    <h1> Mechatronics Project </h1> <p class = "content">JAN - APR 2016</p>
    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content"> The team of three students is tasked with configuring and programming a 2WD robot to accomplish autonomous navigation on a playfield, and to compete against other robots in a head-to-head goal-scoring competition. The Arduino board contains an ATMEGA328 microcontroller chip produced by ATMEL. Throughout the semester we will be familiarizing ourselves with the Arduino environment and the capabilities of the robot. </p>

    <h1> Computer Architecture Lab </h1> <p class = "content">JAN 2015 - APR 2016</p>
    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content"> These set of 6 labs introduce writing assembly language using Altera's Nios II processor and the Altera Monitor Program. The first lab had the class write code that would ouput characters to the terminal window. The lectures also teach all about processors (functions of specific registers, RISC vs. CISC architecture, little vs. big endian addressing) and a detailed breakdown of the structure of a general computer. </p>
