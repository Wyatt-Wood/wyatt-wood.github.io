    <h1> Wooden Bike</h1> <p class = "content">JAN - APR 2015</p>
    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content"> A wooden bike was developed by a team of 4 students at Queen's University as a design for the first-year, full-semester design course, APSC-100. We were given a client, Queen's Biomechanical Research Group, who expected the final prototype to meet the following specifications: 
        </p>
        
        <ul class = "content">
            <li>Made from environmentally friendly materials (completely from wood if possible),</li>
            <li>Cost-effective materials,</li>
            <li>Weight limit greater than the average human,</li>
            <li>Comfortable for a rider taller than 6â€™.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class = "content">From these specifications, we decided that we would build a road bike. This meant that the materials used must be very light, and that the rider would be expected to ride for a long period of time, meaning that we had to position the handlebars accordingly. It was a general consensus that the group would use wood for the frame, but a more comfortable seat would be used, and it was assumed that the wheels would be pre-manufactured. Note that there are not pedals or chain to propel the bike. We felt this was outside of our scope as we dedicated much of our time to modelling the bike rather than creating a prototype. The bike complies with safety regulations as there is a light reflector on the front and back of the bike. The final report detailed: 
        </p>
        
        <ul class = "content">
            <li>Force analysis of an ideal model,</li>
            <li>Solid Edge model,</li>
            <li>Detailed project timeline,</li>
            <li>Economic breakdown (including the final cost of all materials).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "content">Ultimately a project proposal, two progress reports, and a final report were written. Team meetings were scheduled for twice a week, and an additional meeting was scheduled with our project manager.
A proposal presentation was given to the project manager, and our client, and the prototype was presented to group of students and three judges.

    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content">  
        A significant amount of social infrastructure has been organized under the assumption that all members of society have full vision. Small visual displays; menus, buttons, and icons that require sight; as well as colour-coded user interfaces, present daily challenges to individuals with visual impairments.
        </p>
        <p class = "content">
         Visual toolbox was developed at Queen's University by a team of four as a design project for the second-year computer engineering course, APSC-200. The application interface was designed with the needs of the visually impaired in mind, and can be used in in conjunction with Talk Back.
        </p>
        <p class = "content">
            Visual Toolbox presents two features that can be used by visually impaired individuals to better understand their environment. For example, the Light Sensor can be used to guide a visually impaired person to a light that has been left on, while the colour sensor can help them sort their white and dark clothes before doing laundry.

        Ultimately a project proposal, two progress reports, and a final report were written. Team meetings were scheduled for twice a week.
A proposal presentation was given to the project manager, and the prototype was presented to group of students and three judges. The final result was presented to the class that included a demo and a pitch to sell the product to a group of students.

    <h1> Mechatronics Project </h1> <p class = "content">JAN - APR 2016</p>
    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content"> The team of three students is tasked with configuring and programming a 2WD robot to accomplish autonomous navigation on a playfield, and to compete against other robots in a head-to-head goal-scoring competition. The Arduino board contains an ATMEGA328 microcontroller chip produced by ATMEL. Throughout the semester we will be familiarizing ourselves with the Arduino environment and the capabilities of the robot. </p>

    <h1> Computer Architecture Lab </h1> <p class = "content">JAN 2015 - APR 2016</p>
    <div class = "contentContainer">
        <p class = "content"> These set of 6 labs introduce writing assembly language using Altera's Nios II processor and the Altera Monitor Program. The first lab had the class write code that would ouput characters to the terminal window. The second lab introduced the concept of subroutines, and how to implement them. The lectures teach all about processors (functions of specific registers, RISC vs. CISC architecture, little vs. big endian addressing) and a detailed breakdown of the structure of a general computer. </p>
