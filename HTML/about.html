        <b>Reading |</b> I enjoy reading high fantasy books, biographies of influential people, technical texts, and articles. I enjoy keeping up with advancements in technology and read many articles each day to learn more (I suggest using 'Pocket' for iOS to save articles and links for later if you are busy at the time of seeing them). My recently read books consist of: </p>
        
        <ul class = "content">
            <li>The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales by J.R.R Tolkien</li>
            <li>Game of Thrones (Books 1-5) by George R.R. Martin</li>
            <li>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</li>
            <li>Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance</li>
            <li>A+ Certification by Michael Meyers and Scott Jernigan</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class = "content">
        <b>Guitar |</b> I have played guitar for six years. I have a Schecter Hellraiser Special, an Epiphone Les Paul, and an Indie Standard Floy. My setup consists of a Zakk Wylde distortion pedal run through a Blackstar HT-5 amplifier. </p>
        <p class = "content"> <b>Hockey |</b> I played house league hockey for about 9 years before I reached university and am still an avid fan of the sport.</p>
        
         <p class = "content">
        <b>Music |</b> I mainly listen to hard rock and metal bands as the songs are technically challenging to play on guitar, although I sometimes listen to rap or electronic music.   </p>
        
        <p class = "content">
        <b>Future |</b> Currently the entire field of computer science, software, and hardware sounds like an amazing place to work in, but in particular I would love to work in the fields of computer security, game development, or hardware design. Currently I enjoy writing in assembly language in my Computer Architecture course. We are working with the NIOS II processor supplied by Altera. </p>
